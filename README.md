* The navigation bar sits at the top of the page, and is consistent across each page.
* The navigation bar links to the Home page, About Us page and Give Feedback page respectively, negating the need to use the browser's back button.
* The navigation bar is fully responsive and changes colour when hovered over.

### Hero Image

* The hero image is present on all three pages.
* The colour scheme of the rest of the site is based on the muted colours of the hero image.

![Footer hovered over](assets/images/footer-hover.png)

* The footer is consistent across all three pages and contains clickable text that will take the user to the top of the screen.
* The footer reduces the need for the user to use their scrollbar to access the navigation bar at the top of the screen.

### About Us Page

* The About Us page gives some context of the creators of the quiz, a cat charity named Feline Friends.
* The page utilises Bootstrap containers to better divide the different sections of information, providing both contact information and opening hours as well as a general 'About Us' section.

### Give Feedback Page

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour scheme](assets/images/colour-scheme.png)

I have used a black and grey colour scheme in keeping with the hero image, to retain a simplistic design.

### Typography

* I have used the font Poppins, imported from Google Fonts.
* I hav used a fallback font of Sans-Serif in the case of importing errors.

### Imagery

* I have used a hero image from Unsplash showing a girl and her silver tabby cat looking at a phone, implied to be completing the quiz together.
* The rest of the site's colours are based on the muted colours in this image.
